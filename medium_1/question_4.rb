# Alyssa was asked to write an implementation of a rolling buffer. Elements are added to the rolling buffer and if the buffer becomes full,
# then new elements that are added will displace the oldest elements in the buffer.

# She wrote two implementations saying, "Take your pick. Do you like << or + for modifying the buffer?".
# Is there a difference between the two, other than what operator she chose to use to add an element to the buffer?

def rolling_buffer1(buffer, max_buffer_size, new_element)
  buffer << new_element
  buffer.shift if buffer.size > max_buffer_size
  buffer
end

# rolling_buffer1 will alter the buffer (array) when it is passed in because the << method is mutates the caller.

def rolling_buffer2(input_array, max_buffer_size, new_element)
  buffer = input_array + [new_element]
  buffer.shift if buffer.size > max_buffer_size
  buffer
end

# rolling_buffer2 will not alter the original input_array.
